You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen... when your heart's not open

You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken... when your heart's not open

If I could melt your heart
We'd never be apart
Give yourself to me
You... hold... the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I'd suffer the same
If I lose you... my heart will be broken
